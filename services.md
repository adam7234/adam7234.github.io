Keep your home in great shape.

Blueprint Home Services helps you maintain the quality of your space with clean, careful work — the kind of small fixes that protect your home and prevent bigger problems later.

If you have a punch-list, you’re the ideal client. Send photos + your list and I’ll confirm fit and next availability.

## The work I do most

### 1) Punch-list visits (best value)
Multiple small tasks in one appointment. Common items:
- Mount shelves, mirrors, curtain rods, hooks
- Patch small drywall holes / anchor damage
- Adjust doors (sticking, sagging, latch alignment)
- Replace basic hardware (handles, knobs, hinges)
- Seal and re-caulk (kitchen/bath where accessible)

### 2) Drywall patches + touch-ups
- Small holes, dents, nail pops
- Patch → sand → ready for paint
- Paint touch-ups (best if you have matching paint)

### 3) Mounting & installation
- Shelves, blinds, bathroom accessories
- TV mounting (stud mounting only)
- Light assembly / installs (non-electrical)

### 4) Sealing & weatherproofing
These are small jobs that prevent expensive ones:
- Re-caulking tubs, showers, sinks
- Weatherstripping / door sweeps
- Sealing gaps around trim and penetrations

### 5) Light plumbing swaps (simple + accessible)
- Faucets, showerheads, sprayers
- Toilet seat / basic toilet internals (flapper/fill valve)
If anything looks corroded, leaking, or risky, I’ll stop and recommend a plumber. No gambling with water.
