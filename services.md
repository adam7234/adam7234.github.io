About

Blueprint Home Services is a Baltimore-based handyman and maintenance service focused on turnovers, small repairs, and make-ready closeouts.

I provide clean work, clear communication, and a predictable process — especially for clients who already have a list (turn list, inspection items, punch list).

Best fit

- Rental turnovers / make-ready lists
- Inspection repair lists
- Bundled small fixes in one visit

Common services

- Doors and hardware (locks, hinges, latches, alignment)
- Drywall patching and touch-up prep
- Caulk, sealing, basic weatherproofing
- Mounting and installs (shelves, blinds, curtain rods, TV mounts)
- Light plumbing swaps (faucets, showerheads, toilet internals where accessible)
- Seasonal maintenance checklists and prep

How it works

1) Send details: short list + photos (wide + close-up) + zip code.
2) I confirm fit and send an estimate (or recommend a short assessment visit).
3) Schedule a turn block (Thursdays + Sundays).
4) Closeout provided: what was done, materials used, and any watch-outs.

What to expect

- Clear communication and realistic timelines
- Respect for your space (cleaner in, cleaner out)
- No upsells, no surprises
- If it’s outside scope, I’ll tell you quickly and point you to the right trade

Service area
